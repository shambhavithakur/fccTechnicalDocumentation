              Shopping and social-media websites and other task-based
              web&nbsp;applications are expected to retrieve, transfer, and
              display data in real time. For example, a shopping website must
              retrieve up-to-date product data from a database server and
              display the data to users dynamically. You don't want the users to
              wait until a web&nbsp;developer adds the data to the website code.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you want to build task-based, dynamic web&nbsp;applications,
              you need something more than HTML, CSS, and client-side
              JavaScript, which typically output hard-coded content. You need a
              suitable server-side technology. Node.js is one such technology.
              This primer discusses the features and benefits of Node and
              explains how you can use Node for Windows to perform simple
              server-side tasks.

            <p>
              Node is a runtime environment that interprets and runs JavaScript
              code on the server side. Node is both open source and platform
              independent. Anyone who wants to use Node can
              <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank"
                >download</a
              >
              and install it on a standard computer or server operating system
              (OS).
            </p>
            <p>
              Because Node runs on an OS directly, it does not support
              browser-specific JavaScript application programming interfaces
              (APIs). Instead, it is configured to work with traditional OS
              APIs, including hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) and file system
              libraries.
            </p>
            <p>
              To enable task automation, Node comes bundled with a core set of
              files, each of which is preconfigured to perform a specific task.
              Each file in this core set is called a module. Examples of
              preconfigured Node&nbsp;modules include the following:
            </p>
            <ul class="node-module-list">
              <li>
                <strong><code>http</code></strong
                >: To transfer data using hyper text transfer protocol (HTTP),
                use the <code>http</code>&nbsp;module.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong><code>console</code></strong
                >: This module makes a simple debugging console available to
                you.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong><code>path</code></strong
                >: If you want to work with file and directory paths, use the
                <code>path</code>&nbsp;module.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              You are not restricted to using the core set of modules, however.
              You can also employ third-party modules and create your own
              modules to perform common tasks.

          <div class="main-section__details">
            <p>Node offers the following benefits to &nbsp;developers:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Familiarity and focus</strong>: If you use Node, you can
                build an entire web&nbsp;application using JavaScript. You don't
                have to switch between different technologies for the client and
                server sides.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Up-to-date language</strong>: JavaScript is continuously
                being improved. It offers a simplified syntax and code structure
                and compatibility with recent upgrades to web-server technology.
                Further, many new and popular languages, such as CoffeeScript
                and LiveScript, can easily be converted into JavaScript.
                Therefore, you can also write server-side code for Node in these
                new languages.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Efficiency</strong>: You can quickly solve common
                web-development problems with Node. You can also be assured that
                applications that you build with Node have optimized throughput
                and are scalable.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Reusability</strong>: Numerous reusable modules and
                libraries are available for Node today, and you can quickly
                install these modules and libraries using the node package
                manager (NPM).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Extensive support</strong>: Node is supported on most
                web-hosting platforms. In addition, it has a vibrant and helpful
                community of developers and third-party module providers. This
                means that you can easily resolve any problems during the
                installation and use of Node-based web&nbsp;applications.

              To install a stable version of Node on Windows, perform the
              following steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Go to
                <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank"
                  >https://nodejs.org/en/</a
                >.
              </li>
              <li>
                Select the button that contains the text "Recommended for most
                users". This will initiate the download of the most recent,
                recommended version of the Node installation file. This file
                will be in the Microsoft Installer (MSI) format and have a .msi
                extension.
              </li>
              <li>
                In the Save As dialog box that opens, browse to the folder where
                you want to save the Node installation file, and then click
                <strong class="save-button-name">Save</strong>.
              </li>
              <li>
                After the installation file has been downloaded, access the
                folder were you saved the file and double-click the file.
              </li>
              <li>Follow the default installation prompts to install Node.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              An alternative and quicker way to install Node is to use the
              <a href="https://chocolatey.org/about" target="_blank"
                >Chocolatey</a
              >
              package manager. To install Node with Chocolatey, perform the
              following steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Install Chocolatey using the instructions available at
                <a href="https://chocolatey.org/install" target="_blank"
                  >https://chocolatey.org/install</a
                >.
              </li>
              <li>
                Install Node by running the following command from the command
                line or the PowerShell:<br />
                <pre><code>choco install nodejs-lts</code></pre>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Verifying Your Installation</h3>
            <p>
              After you are through with the installation steps, both Node and
              NPM should be installed on your computer. You can verify these
              installations by running the following commands at the command
              prompt separately:
            </p>
            <ul class="node-npm-commands">
              <li>
                <pre><code>node -v</code></pre>
              </li>
              <li>
                <pre><code>npm -v</code></pre>
              </li>

          <div class="main-section__details">
            <p>
              You can use the modules of Node to build various types of
              &nbsp;applications. For example, you can build a simple
              web&nbsp;server with the <code>http</code>&nbsp;module.
            </p>
            <h3>Building a Web&nbsp;Server</h3>
            <p>
              Suppose you want to build a web&nbsp;server named test-node that
              listens for any kind of HTTP request at
              <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/" target="_blank"
                >http://127.0.0.1:8000/</a
              >. When a request is received, test-node responds with the string
              "Hello World". You can perform the following steps to build
              test-node:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Open the command-line utility.</li>
              <li>
                Run the following command to create a folder named test-node:
                <pre><code>mkdir test-node</code></pre>
              </li>
              <li>
                Run the following command to browse to the test-node folder:
                <pre><code>cd test-node</code></pre>
              </li>
              <li>In a text editor, create a file named hello.js.</li>
              <li>
                In the hello.js file, paste the following code:
                <pre><code>// Load HTTP module
var http = require("http");
                    
// Create HTTP server and listen on port 8000
http.createServer(function(request, response) {
                    
  // Set response HTTP header
  response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
                       
  // Send response text
  response.end('Hello World\n');
}).listen(8000);
                    
// Print URL for accessing server
console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/');</code></pre>
              </li>
              <li>Save the hello.js file in the test-node folder.</li>
              <li>
                At the command prompt, run the following command:
                <pre><code>node "hello.js"</code></pre>
              </li>
              <li>
                In a web&nbsp;browser, access
                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/" target="_blank"
                  >http://127.0.0.1:8000/</a
                >. You should see the text "Hello World" in the upper left
                corner of the &nbsp;page that opens.
              </li>
            </ol>
